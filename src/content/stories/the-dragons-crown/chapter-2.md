The icy wind howled through the mountain peaks as Lyra pulled her cloak tighter around her shoulders. The Misty Mountains lived up to their name – swirling clouds of fog obscured the treacherous path ahead, making each step a calculated risk.

Master Thaddeus's warning still echoed in her mind. The Crimson Hand, a secret society of dark mages, was also searching for the Crown. They had been following her progress, waiting for her to decipher the map's secrets. Now it was a race against time.

The ancient map had led her here, to these forbidding peaks. According to the texts, the Hidden Temple lay somewhere within these mountains, its entrance marked by the "tears of the dragon" – whatever that meant.

A glint of light caught her eye. Through the swirling mist, she spotted something unusual: a series of crystalline formations cascading down the mountainside, catching and refracting the weak sunlight like frozen tears.

"The tears of the dragon," Lyra whispered, a smile spreading across her face. She had found it.

But as she approached the crystal formation, a dark figure emerged from the mist behind her, slow-clapping. "Well done, Miss Blackwood. I must thank you for leading us straight to it..."
