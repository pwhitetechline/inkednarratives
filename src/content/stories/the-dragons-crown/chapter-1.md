The candlelight flickered across the weathered parchment as Lyra Blackwood carefully unrolled the ancient map. Her hands trembled slightly – not from fear, but from excitement. After years of searching through dusty archives and forgotten libraries, she had finally found it.

The map to the Dragon's Crown.

Most scholars dismissed the Crown as mere legend, a fairy tale told to children on cold winter nights. But Lyra knew better. The signs were there, hidden in plain sight for those who knew where to look. The recurring symbols in ancient texts, the mysterious references in royal chronicles, and now this map – it all pointed to one undeniable truth: the Crown was real.

Her fingers traced the intricate lines on the parchment, following the path that would lead her to the first marker. The map showed a journey through treacherous territories – the Shadowmist Valley, the Peaks of Eternal Storm, and finally, the mysterious Temple of the First Flame.

A knock at her study door startled her from her thoughts. "Enter," she called, hastily rolling up the map.

The door creaked open to reveal her old mentor, Master Thaddeus, his face grave. "Lyra, you need to know something about that map you've found. You're not the only one looking for it..."
