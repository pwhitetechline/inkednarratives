The morning after Luke Donovan’s unexpected visit, Evelyn found herself distracted while pruning the lower branches of her lemon trees. She had spent the better part of the night replaying their conversation, trying to convince herself that the warm flicker in her chest was nothing more than mild curiosity. And yet, there was something about him—the easy confidence, the way he listened intently—that unsettled her in a way she hadn’t felt in a long time.

Clementine, perched lazily on a nearby wooden crate, flicked her tail as if sensing her thoughts.

“Oh, hush,” Evelyn muttered, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow. “You act like I invited him over for dinner.”

She focused back on her work, snipping away at overgrown shoots, letting the rhythm soothe her mind. But before she could truly settle into her task, the unmistakable sound of tires crunching over gravel reached her ears.

Heart skipping, she straightened, brushing dirt off her jeans. Sure enough, that same rusted blue pickup truck was making its way up the path.

Clementine stretched, unimpressed. Evelyn exhaled. “You have got to be kidding me.”

Luke climbed out of the truck with a sheepish grin. “Morning.”

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. “Didn’t get enough lemons yesterday?”

He held up his hands in mock surrender. “Actually, I came to apologize.”

She tilted her head. “For what?”

“For showing up unannounced. My aunt told me after the fact that people around here don’t usually just drop in like that.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Thought I might’ve overstepped.”

Evelyn folded her arms. “Well, that depends. Did your aunt also tell you that people around here expect apologies to come with coffee?”

Luke laughed. “Noted for next time.”

Despite herself, Evelyn found her lips twitching. “You’re lucky I was already out here working, otherwise, I might’ve had to chase you off with a broom.”

“Duly noted,” he said with a smirk, leaning casually against his truck. “Since I’m already here, maybe you could use an extra set of hands?”

Evelyn hesitated. She was used to doing things alone and had long since settled into the rhythm of solitary work. But the offer caught her off guard, and she shrugged before she could stop herself. “I suppose I could put you to work.”

Luke grinned. “That’s what I like to hear.”

She handed him gloves and pruning shears, and she led him through the grove, showing him how to trim the lower branches to encourage new growth. He followed her instructions easily, moving through the rows of trees with an ease that suggested he wasn’t unfamiliar with hard work. It was oddly comfortable, the two of them working in tandem, the steady snip of shears filling the warm air.

Evelyn stole a glance at him, noting how he moved with patience, his brows furrowed in concentration. There was something calming about watching him work, something she wasn’t quite ready to name.

After an hour, Luke wiped his forehead and leaned against a tree, studying her. “You really love this place, don’t you?”

Evelyn paused, glancing around at the trees that had stood for generations. “I do. It’s not always easy, but it’s worth it.”

He nodded. “I get that. My granddad felt the same way about the hardware store.”

She looked at him curiously. “Did you ever think about taking it over?”

Luke hesitated, his gaze drifting toward the horizon. “I did, once. But life took me in a different direction. I was in construction for a while, then project management in the city. It was steady, paid well, but…”

“But it wasn’t home?” Evelyn guessed.

Luke smiled, the kind of smile that held a trace of something bittersweet. “Yeah. Something like that.”

Evelyn considered his words. She understood that feeling all too well—the pull of home, even when it wasn’t part of the original plan.

A comfortable silence settled between them before Evelyn dusted off her gloves. “Well, since you survived your first round of pruning, I suppose you earned yourself a break. Come on, I’ll grab us some lemonade.”

Luke pushed off the tree, grinning. “Now that’s an offer I won’t refuse.”

As they walked back toward the house, Clementine trotted after them, tail flicking in what Evelyn swore was satisfaction. And for the first time in a long time, she didn’t mind the company.
