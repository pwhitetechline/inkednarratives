With his easy charm and restless heart, he stirs something in her she isn’t ready to name. But as storms—both literal and emotional—sweep through her orchard, Evelyn must decide if she’s willing to let someone in. Some things in life aren’t meant to be planned, and maybe, just maybe, love is one of them."

Nestled in the heart of a small town, Evelyn Harper’s life is as steady and predictable as the lemon trees she tends—until Luke Donovan rolls in with his rusted pickup and a past he isn’t sure he wants to leave behind. Between unexpected storms, small-town gossip, and the warmth of freshly squeezed lemonade, their worlds intertwine in ways neither anticipated. A slow-burn romance about love, home, and the unexpected beauty of life’s unplanned moments.
